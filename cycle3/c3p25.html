<h1> css </h1>
<p>css or cascading style sheets allow you to control your page layout or a simple way to add style (e.g. font,colors,spacing).
 html deals with structure while css deals with style.
 with css,you will recognize some similarities with html attribute names and values. but in css, you will use curly braces { } colons : and semi colons ; and you will use selectors and declarations.
 good html and css writing practice it to test one body or block of the codes at a time,instead of writing the code from the start to finish and then test the whole program,more often than not there will be errors that you will encounter and the longer the program to test the most likely you will have bugs in the code.</p>
